# algo_projects

this projects are the projects i've done while i was taking algorithm courses and categorized by the course. Under each course folder there are several independent 
project folders. titles of the projects are pretty much self explanatory. Among all especially the princeton p2 folder has interesting 
projects & algorithms that was both challenging and interesting to work on.
